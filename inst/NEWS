NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2.2.0
------------------------

     o Find the peaks with bi-directional promoters with summary
     statistics (peaksNearBDP).

     o Summarize the occurrence of motifs in peaks
     (summarizePatternInPeaks).

     o Add other IDs to annotated peaks or enrichedGO (addGeneIDs)The
     function makeVennDiagram supports 4-way venn diagram.

     o Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms are annotated with a list of
     genes which can be traced back to peaks.

     o FAQ: http://pgfe.umassmed.edu/ChIPpeakAnno/FAQ.html.

     o Summarize peak distribution over exon, intron, enhancer, proximal promoter, 5 prime UTR and 3 prime UTR (assignChromosomeRegion)
