\description{
Find the overlapping peaks for two input peak ranges.

findOverlappingPeaks(Peaks1, Peaks2, maxgap = 100, multiple = c(TRUE, FALSE), NameOfPeaks1 = "TF1", NameOfPeaks2 = "TF2")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Peaks1}{
RangedData: See example below.
}
  \item{Peaks2}{
RangedData: See example below.
}
  \item{maxgap}{
Non-negative integer. Intervals with a separation of maxgap or less are considered to be overlapping.
}
  \item{multiple}{
TRUE or FALSE: TRUE may return multiple overlapping peaks in Peaks2 for one peak in Peaks1; FALSE will return at most one overlapping peaks in Peaks2 for one peak in Peaks1.
}
  \item{NameOfPeaks1}{
Name of the Peaks1, used for generating column name.
}
  \item{NameOfPeaks2}{
Name of the Peaks2, used for generating column name.
}
}
\details{
Efficiently perform overlap queries with an interval tree implemented in IRanges.
}
\value{
  \item{OverlappingPeaks}{a data frame consists of input peaks information with added information: overlapFeature (upstream: peak1 resides upstream of the peak2; downstream: peak1 resides downstream of the peak2; inside: peak1 resides inside the peak2 entirely; overlapStart: peak1 overlaps with the start of the peak2; overlapEnd: peak1 overlaps with the end of the peak2; includeFeature: peak1 include the peak2 entirely) and shortestDistance (shortest distance between the overlapping peaks}
  \item{MergedPeaks}{RangedData contains merged overlapping peaks}
