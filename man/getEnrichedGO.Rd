\title{ Obtain enriched gene ontology (GO) terms that near the peaks }
\description{
  Obtain enriched gene ontology (GO) terms that are near the peaks using GO.db package and GO gene mapping package such as org.Hs.db.eg to obtain the GO annotation and using hypergeometric test (phyper) and  multtest package for adjusting p-values
}
\usage{
getEnrichedGO(annotatedPeak, orgAnn, feature_id_type="ensembl_gene_id", maxP=0.01, multiAdj=FALSE, minGOterm=10, multiAdjMethod="")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{annotatedPeak}{RangedData such as data(annotatedPeak) or a vector of feature IDs }

 \item{feature_id_type}{the feature type in annotatedPeakRanges such as ensembl_gene_id, refseq_id, gene_symbol or entrez_id}
  \item{maxP}{ maximum p-value to be considered to be significant}
