\title{
Make Venn Diagram from two peak ranges
}
\description{
Make Venn Diagram from two peak ranges and also calculate p-value for determining whether two peak ranges overlap significantly.
}
\usage{
makeVennDiagram(Peaks, NameOfPeaks, maxgap=0, totalTest, cex = 1.5, counts.col = "red")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Peaks}{
RangedDataList: See example below.
}
  \item{NameOfPeaks}{
Character vector to specify the name of Peaks, e.g., c("TF1", "TF2"), this will be used as label in the Venn Diagram.
}
 \item{maxgap}{
 Non-negative integer. Intervals with a separation of maxgap or less are considered to be overlapping.
}
\item{totalTest}{
Numeric value to specify the total number of tests performed to obtain the list of peaks.
}
  \item{cex}{
Numerical value giving the amount by which the contrast names should be scaled on the plot relative to the default.plotting text. See par.}
  \item{counts.col}{
 optional vector of color specifications defining the colors by which the circles should be drawn. See par.
}
}
\details{
This is a wrapper function for vennDiagram from limma package.
}
\value{
In addition to a Venn Diagram produced, p.value is obtained from hypergeometric test for determining whether the two peak ranges overlap significantly.
